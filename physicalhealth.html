            <h2>What is Physical Health&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>Physical health is the total wellbeing of the body, and what goes in and out of it. It's how the body moves and feels, and how it's taken care of.</p>
            <h2>Exercise</h2>
            <p>Regular physical activity has a variety of health benefits. That range from weight control/loss, preventing health conditions and diseases. Improved mood, higher energy,  and better sleeping habits.</p>
            <h2>Streaching</h2>
            <p> Stretching before activities is necessary to stay healthy. It loosens the muscles and allows them to be flexible. Stretching is always overlooked and forgotten about when it comes to physical activities. Stretching should always happen before and after an exercise or a physical activity. Stretching is a key practice to have to keep your muscles flexible and healthy.</p>
